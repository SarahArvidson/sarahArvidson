          How to Make Some Bomb Ass Chocky-Chip Cookies That Your Husband Who
          Doesn't Even Like Chocolate Will Like
        </h2>
        <h3>Ingredients & Preparation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>3 Cups of All-Purpose Flour</li>
          <li>2 3/4 Cups of White Sugar</li>
          <li>3 Large Eggs* see instructions below</li>
          <li>2 Hershey Bars or Chocolate Chips</li>
          <li>1 Teaspoon of Salt</li>
          <li>1 Teaspoon of Baking Soda</li>
          <li>1 Teaspoon of Vanilla Extract</li>
          <li>1 Tablespoon of 100% Canadian Maple Syrup</li>
          <li>1 Cup of Softened, Salter Butter* See instructions below</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Phase 1</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Get the cast iron skillets out of the oven and preheat it to 375
            degrees.
          </li>
          <li>
            Butter: use salted Amish Rolled Butter for these cookies. You'll
            need to get a liquid measuring cup and put 1 cup of water in it.
            Then, you'll need to add slivers of butter gradually to that
            measuring cup until the water displaces to the level of 2 cups.
            Strain the water out; you now have 1 cup of softened, salted butter.
            Set it aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Get a medium sized bowl and put the flour, baking soda, and salt in
            it. You can take a whisk or a fork and gently stir it. Set it aside.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Phase 2</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Get a big bowl what's gonna be for mixing inside of.</li>
          <li>
            Put your butter, vanilla extract, maple syrup, and sugar in it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Eggs: now get a small bowl or container near the size of something
            you'd eat cereal out of, and crack just an egg white into it. You
            can transfer the yolk back and forth between two sides of the egg
            shell if you've managed to crack it that way, but you'll need to
            discard the egg white and put only the yolk into your big bowl with
            the sugar in it. Once you've done that, add two large eggs with the
            whites and the yolks. Do whatever you want with the leftover egg
            white in the bowl. The dog likes it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using a mixer, mix this gooey concotion up until it's mostly smooth.
            Be careful not to over-do it.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Phase 3</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            This is the fun part: adding a little bit at a time, gently
            introduce your flour powder into your wet concoction. Use a medium
            speed and feel comfortable backing down to lower speeds if you need
            to.
          </li>
          <li>
            Check to see if it has lumps of flour all over in it. If it does,
            you probably put in too much flour at once and you'll need to try to
            mix it in without overdoing it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add chocolate chips or salsa or whatever. At this point, I usually
            switch to a spoon to do this. I don't want to overmix.
          </li>
          <li>
            I like to use two spoons to do this, but figure out a way to get
            them onto the cookie sheets. Space them evenly. Or don't. It's your
            life.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Phase 4</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Bake for 9 minutes.</li>
          <li>CLEAN THE MESS YOU MADE DURING THESE NINE MINUTES.</li>
          <li>
            Let them cool down before you remove them from the tray; they're
            continuing to bake a bit, and if you remove them too early, they'll
            stick to the pan.
          </li>
          <li>Share the cookies. The cookies are meant to be shared.</li>
        </ol>
