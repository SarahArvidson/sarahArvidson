Hi!

I'm working on becoming a full-stack developer. My background is in human languages, education, and the outdoor industry.

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio site and a collection of projects I have built while learning web development.

## About me

I am a highly-committed developer in development. Before transitioning into tech, I earned multiple advanced degrees, worked and travelled on three different continents, and became a whitewater kayaking instructor in my spare time. I enjoy board games and cards, building practical tools, working on creative projects, traveling, and spending time with my dog.

## How this site was built

This site uses a CSS Grid layout for the main page structure and flexbox for internal component layout. The quotes section uses JavaScript to randomly rotate through inspiring quotes on hover. These are all quotes I've memorized and which deeply influence how I view and navigate the world around me. All styling is custom with no third-party frameworks.
