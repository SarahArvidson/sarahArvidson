      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! Welcome to being right here, right now. Thanks for your
        attention.<br />
        I'm positively chuffed that you're here, so let's get to it: I'm a Full
        Stack Developer in development, which means I'm plodding my way through
        a course for it but haven't finished quite yet. I'm obviously interested
        in coding, but I do and have done a great many other things, too. Here
        are some highlights:
      <ul id="highlights">
        <li>
          I have two master's degrees and a PhD; they're basically in human
          languages
        </li>
        <li>I learned how to knit this year</li>
        <li>
          I'm a certified scrum product owner, wilderness first responder, and
          have training in swiftwater rescue and CPR
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

        <h3>Chatt With Me</h3>
        <p>A random date-night generator for me and my spouse, written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Bill's Banana Carvings</h3>
        <p>
          A totally ridiculous HTML & CSS project for Codecademy, in which I was
          meant to create a website for a fictitious business.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Gynmnastiband</h3>
        <p>
          A Codecademy challenge project to create a website for a fictitious
          club. It was also written in HTML & CSS.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <section class="taco-time"><h2>TACO TIME</h2></section>
    <p>TACO TIME is an acronym of my own invention! It stands for Take A Chance Often and Taste Its Mighty Effects. </br>
      TACO TIME is a tantalizing way to boil down "the aggregate of marginal gains initiated for self-advancemment through targeted engineering and entrepreneurship skills acquisition." 
      At its core, it's just a self-improvement and progress mindset. I have a lot of enthusiasm and zest for life, and I want to get as much out of it as possible, so I'm usually trying to "level up" in several areas of my life at a time. 
      The only way this is manageable for me is by conceptualizing my big, hairy audacious goals as projects with SMART goals baked in and served up with some good old-fashioned habit formation. The aggregate of marginal gains guarantees progress. </p>
      <section><h3>Taco of the Month(s)</h3>
      <p>The Codecademy Full Stack Fundido<br />
      Appetizer (what motivated me): I've been interested in computers and coding for a very long time, but it seemed really inaccessible to me. When I quit my full-time teaching job to start something new, I learned about Codecademy's options for self-paced
       courses at cheaper prices than bootcamps taught by instructors.<br />
      Main (the principal goal): Finish the Full Stack Developer course and feel like I did it well. <br />
      Sides (related tasks): read books, listen to podcasts, play coding games on Codepip, work on client projects, audit a computer science course at the university where I work part-time as an adjunct professor. <br />
      Dessert (potential rewards layered on top of meeting the goal): landing a job or enough client work that quitting my full-time teaching job makes financial sense.<br />
