      <p>
        Hi! Welcome to being right here, right now. Thanks for your
        attention.<br />
        I'm positively chuffed that you're here, so let's get to it: I'm a Full
        Stack Developer in development, which means I'm plodding my way through
        a course for it but haven't finished quite yet. I'm obviously interested
        in coding, but I do and have done a great many other things, too. Here
        are some highlights:</p>
      <ul id="highlights">
        <li>
          I have two master's degrees and a PhD; they're basically in human
          languages
        </li>
        <li>I learned how to knit this year</li>
        <li>
          I'm a certified scrum product owner, wilderness first responder, and
          have training in swiftwater rescue and CPR
        </li>
      </ul>
